== Overview

== Motivation

== Approach

== Install

Install the gem with:

    gem install bunnicula
          or
    sudo gem install bunnicula


== An Example

== Limitations
* Cubicle cannot currently cause child documents to be emitted in the map reduce. This is a pretty big limitation, and will be resolved shortly.
* Documentation is non-existent. This is being worked on (head that one before?)
* Test coverage is OK, but the tests could be better organized
* Code needs to be modularized a bit, main classes are pretty hairy at the moment
